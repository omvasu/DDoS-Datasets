# DDoS-Datasets
DDoS generated Datasets
This Dataset was produced on a single machine equipped with an Intel i7 11th generation 2.30 GHz processor, 64 GB RAM, and a 2 TB hard disk. Within a VMware environment, four virtual machines were set up, comprising one Linux machine (LVPC), two Windows machines (WVPC-1 and WVPC-2), and one Windows server (WVS). These virtual machines were interconnected through VMware network adapters on single NIC card of the host machine with IP version 6 addresses.
To generate a traffic in the instance of an attack, an ICMPv6 DDoS attack was launched using a Scapy script. The attack is launched from two virtual machines (LVPC and WVPC-1), targeting the Windows server (WVS). The ensuing network traffic, encompassing both normal activity and the ICMPv6 attack, was captured on the Windows server (WVS) using Wireshark, resulting in a dataset size of 18.3 MB (60,000 bytes/sec). Subsequently, the captured traffic underwent transformation into an Excel sheet as scdtsets.csv of size 58.2 MB. The proposed Model was employed on these data sets.
